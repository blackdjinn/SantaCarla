These might seem harsh. 
They are worded firmly not because we're angry abotu it but because we mean business and violations are unacceptable.
\section{Characters}
\subsection{Age}
No characters under 18 years old.
No PBs under 18.
No players under 18.
We don't need the headaches.
\section{Items}
\subsection{Super-Tech}
If you can't buy it somewhere, you can't make it using mundane techniques.
SUPER-tech is SUPER-natural in nature.
I don't care it it's an a movie.

\subsection{Crafting}
Crafting is one of those Special Snowflake sorts of deals. You are, and if
you buy the skills, you should get to use them. But the harder you make
your request on staff, the farther down the queue it slips. Some stuff,
we'll just say `no' because it's too complex to make/require
years of research to get the techniques.
\subsection{Ubiquity}
Any item that becomes commonplace will probably get nerfed. That implies
it grants an advantage that can't  be lived without, and so it's
overpowered.
